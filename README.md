# Finite Automata, Formal Languages, and Grammars

This repository contains LaTeX source code based on the Hessen Informatik curriculum, covering finite automata, formal languages, and grammars.

## Curriculum Coverage

- **Finite Automata**: Deterministic and non-deterministic finite automata (including epsilon NFAs), state diagrams, transition tables, regular expressions, automata limitations, DFA minimization, and powerset construction.
- **Formal Languages and Grammars**: Regular and context-free grammars, derivations, parse trees, syntax diagrams, language definitions, and the Chomsky hierarchy.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/username/latex-automata-grammars.git`
2. Compile the LaTeX code with `pdflatex`.
